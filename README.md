Learning related to configuration will be noted for solving same problems in the future.

# Purpose
As the technologies and cool features are on demand, its very common for netizens to activate `monk mode` on the primary targets such as studies, researches, or the work. This leaves many of us to ignore/slack on basic technicalities, especially configurating system components or pipelining several steps to achieve technical problems. 

Thus, I created a short and sweet description on several technical issues that I encountered. Keeping this dairy helps me to troubleshoot me in the future if I faced same problem again. 

If the description starts to expand, several ways of maintainance will be considered in future.
